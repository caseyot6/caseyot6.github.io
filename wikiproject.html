    <h1 id = "pagetitle"> What can it do? </h1>
    <p>
        The application retrieves a page name from Wikipedia based on an inquiry. When it gets an existing page name,
        it retrieves the names of related Wikipedia pages. Each page name provided can be investigated as a new inquiry by
        clicking, and the number of steps the user has taken from the initial search is also displayed.
        <br><br>
        If a page title catches the user's eye, they can visit the page in a browser as well.

     <h1 id = "pagetitle"> Why make this? </h1>
     <p>
     There's a phenomenon called "6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon". The idea is that every human being on Earth
     is at least 6 or so acquiantances apart. So the related idea of figuring out how quickly I could get from
     one topic on Wikipedia to another topic crossed my mind. Trying to play out this investigation
     on a Wikipedia page is not fun, at all, so making an application to just let me look at the links,
     and then go to specific pages that caught my eye seemed much more satisfying.
     </p>
     <h1 id = "pagetitle"> How is it made? </h1>
     <p>
         I'd gained familiarity with C# from game design projects completed in the Unity game engine during college classes.
         I want to move away from creating anything that runs from the command-line, so I investigated different user interface
         frameworks and came across WPF (Windows Presentation Framework), a part of the Microsoft .NET Framework.
         <br><br>
         WPF made UI design a matter of point and click, and separated it from the code behind which interacts with & retrieves JSON from the Wikipedia API.
          Using Visual Studio 2019 made building the application simple; just a few tutorials before clicking the right button.
