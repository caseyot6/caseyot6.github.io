    <h1 id = "pagetitle"> What can it do? </h1>
    <p>
        The application is a sandbox which allows the user to draw on a grid which follows
        rules of the Conway's Game of Life Algorithm. What kind of unique patterns can
        be created from the simple rules followed by each spot on the grid?

    </p>

     <h1 id = "pagetitle"> Why make this? </h1>
     <p>
     I like the idea of emergence, complex behaviors coming from simple principles.
     It's a concept I'd like to explore more seriously in future projects, in the form of an application
     or a game design project.
     <br><br>
     Conway's Game of Life uses only the following 3 rules:

     <ol>
         <li> Filled cells in the grid with more than 2 or 3 neighbors persist.</li>
         <li> Empty cells in the grid with 3 live neighbors become filled. </li>
         <li> All other filled cells become or stay empty. </li>
     </ol>

     </p>
     <h1 id = "pagetitle"> How is it made? </h1>
     <p>

         The application was written using the python language, specifially Python 3.8.3.
         Outside of the latest python version, the pygame module had to be installed before it could be written.
         To avoid having to run it through a console window, I used PyInstaller to wrap it into an executable file.
